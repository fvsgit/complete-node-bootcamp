- NodeJS is just a JS runtime. It runs with the Google V8 engine outside of a browser. V8 parses and runs the code
- Fast, highly scalable applications that run on server side
- Use Cases
-   Single threaded, non-blocking I/O model
-   Fast and scalable
-   Data intensive web applications
-   Data streaming
-   realtime applications
-   best for NoSQL databases
-   samle language on the entire stack, front and backend
-   Production ready
-   Uhe lib of opensource packages in npm
-   Very active community, so a lot of help

Do not build with node when:
